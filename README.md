# InstX

### PROTOTYPE. NOT (VERY) FUNCTIONAL

A client-side service that automatically updates the SearX(NG) instance you use to search based on the best one from [searx.space](https://searx.space). The "best" instance is configuable based criteria such as speed, privacy, and security. It updates the instance by hosting a small web server redirects you to the "best" instance. This web server is then set as your default web browser.
